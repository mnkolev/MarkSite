title: Hello World!
---

It's my first post on my site! As is always customary when delving into something new in the coding world, I will start with the basics by writing out the simple message 'Hello World!' I have been meaning to build this site for a while but was always putting it off until now. More to come in the future!

### The Site

Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
