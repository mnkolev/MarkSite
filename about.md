  Hey there, I'm Mark!
</p>

I am a software developer! I have a Computer Science degree from Virginia Commonwealth University and am a driven individual with a great love for technology and what it holds for the future. My current focus is in C#, Java, and android mobile development. Please check out my [github](https://github.com/mnkolev) repo for some of my current projects! 

Whenever possible, I try to contribute to open source projects. If you would like to work together on a project, please email me at [mnkolev@gmail.com](mailto:mnkolev@gmail.com) and get in touch!
